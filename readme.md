To Caret, From GitHub
=====================

This extension demonstrates using the Caret command API to send source code from GitHub to a new Caret tab. It requires Caret 1.2.25+ to work correctly, but will function with either the Web Store application or the standalone "beta channel" CRX from http://thomaswilburn.net/caret.

It also sends Magic 8-ball predictions to the Caret status bar once a minute. I'm not sure why I thought that was a good idea, but it was a fun addition. Useful if you find yourself wavering over tough programming decisions!
